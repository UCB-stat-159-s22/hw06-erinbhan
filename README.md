## Fine-tuning reproduciblity of LIGO Black Hole signal tutorial, Part II

** Binder link is currently down @ https://mybinder.org/. Once it is up and running, I will publish the binder link here. 

For now, here is the my notebook website. Enjoy! :D

**Note:** This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.
